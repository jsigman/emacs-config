#+title: Emacs Lisp Configuration
#+author: Johnny Sigman

* About

This repository tracks my literate Emacs lisp config. Please use any content that you discover here.

* Installation

These configs rely heavily on [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]], [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], and [[https://github.com/jingtaozf/literate-elisp][literate-elisp]] for a reproducible emacs configuration. These libraries are loaded in [[mode-settings/packages-settings.org][packages-settings.org]]. Every other file relies on them, and is loaded after (as can be seen in [[init.el][init.el]]).

* Content

The configuration content is in elisp code blocks of the ~.org~ files in the [[mode-settings/][mode-settings]] folder.
