* About

This web page is a tangled version of my literate [[https://github.com/jsigman/emacs-config][elisp config]]. Throughout this document, you may find helpful notes, tricks, and comments. I have been tinkering with emacs in some way since 2013. I made this repeatable and git-controlled in 2019, and in 2023 I began to publish it on my web site.

** Notes on code blocks
If a code block is active, then it will appear with ~emacs-lisp~ syntax highlighting. If it's not being used, then it will show up with ~plaintext~ highlighting. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT markdown
{% highlight plaintext %}
(print "This code will not be run!")
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight emacs-lisp %}
(print "This code is run in my config!")
{% endhighlight %}
#+END_EXPORT

Whether a code block is run at load time is controlled by the "~:load yes~" block argument of ~literate-elisp~.
